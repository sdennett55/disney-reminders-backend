When planning a trip to Walt Disney World, folks are strongly encouraged to book their dining reservations and Fast Passes in advance. Dining reservations can be made 180 days prior to their check-in date. FastPass+ Reservations can be made 60 days prior to their check-in date if the customer is staying on Disney property, or 30 days if not.

When booking a trip through Disney, they will usually send you email reminders, but they'll often come in the afternoon on the day of, hours after you could have started booking. This may seem insignificant, but it can cause Disney-goers to miss out on hard-to-get reservations.

The difference with this tool is that you can get on-the-minute reminders via both email and/or text, for free!

These reservations can be made starting at 7am EST, therefore this tool is meant to remind you exactly at 7am, the day before and on the day of.
