When planning a trip to Walt Disney World, it is paramount to a successful vacation that a Disney-goer books their Advance Dining Reservations (ADR) and FastPasses in advance in order to secure popular restaurants and attractions. Dining reservations can be made 180 days prior to check-in date. FastPass+ Reservations can be made 60 days prior to check-in date if the customer is staying on Disney property, or 30 days if not.

When booking a trip through Disney, Disney will usually send email reminders to book these reservations, but they'll often come in the afternoon on the day of, hours after you could have officially started booking. This may seem insignificant, but it can cause Disney-goers to miss out on some of the more sought-after reservations.

The difference with this tool is that you can get on-the-minute reminders via both email and text for free!

Dining reservations can be made online starting at 6am EST and FastPass reservations can be made online starting at 7am EST. This tool is designed to remind you exactly at these times, both 24 hours before and on the day of, so you don't miss a beat.

A subscribed user can unsubscribe at any time via their confirmation email or text. Once unsubscribed, the user is completely removed from the database. This is a small pet project. I have no intentions to sell your data. If you do not wish to submit your contact information, feel free to set your arrival date on the site and then manually add those dates to your calendar or to a reminder on your phone!

Enjoy!
